            Projected Outcome                    
=================================================
=================================================

-Player starts in Passanger Quarters and must look to find the knife. If they don't find the knife
and add it to the inventory then they will probably get eaten by a random spawning shark. Sharks 
can spawn randomly in any room accept for the Passanger Quarters because the player doesn't have 
the knife yet to defend themselves. But after they get the knife and if the first thing they do 
after entering into a new room is to look around then they can defend themselves agaisnt the sharks.
But if they don't have the knife and don't take the time to look first they may get eaten.

-Next the player needs to go up the stairs and to the Officers Quarters to add the map and ancient 
artifact to their inventory. Without those two items they can't win because the Gangsters that are 
financing this expedition are waiting in a boat at the surface. Once in the Officers Quarters they 
have reached a dead end and must journey back the way they came to the Passanger Quarters Stairwell.

-The player needs to pick up the metal coffee cup in the Grand Ballroom, the crowbar, nut and bolt
in order to get past some logic in coming up rooms. 

-Entering the Dining Hall if you don't look first (which you should always do anyways so you don't
get eaten by a shark) then a ghost shuts all the doors and traps the player in and it's game over.
But if they look first then they can use the cup from the GB to block the door.

-Once on the Observation Deck they must have the crowbar, nut and bolt to fix the hinge of the door
in order to get passed

-Once they make it up to the escape boat they must have the map and artifact or the gangsters wont let 
them on the boat.

-So go to every room, look first, add everything to inventory, and get out. You win game over it's that easy.

-It was not that easy to code though I will tell you that right now this project was a menace, it was 
a bear, a thorn in my side for a week. But once I got the map down and the movements it was fun. Oh the logic 
was also super tough. Anywho thanks fore playing my game and/or reading my code hope you enjoyed it.

-FEEL FREE TO TAKE ANY PIECE OF CODE AND USE IT FOR WHATEVER YOU WANT I DON'T MIND, JUST GLAD TO HELP.
