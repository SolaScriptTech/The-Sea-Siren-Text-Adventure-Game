The Sea Siren Text Adventure Game
Overview
The Sea Siren is a text-based adventure game where you explore the wreckage of a sunken luxury cruise liner, uncover its secrets, and survive its many dangers. From random shark attacks to ghostly traps, each room hides opportunities and threats. The ultimate goal: escape to the surface with the required treasures before it's too late.

Story
You slip through a porthole into the wreck of the Sea Siren, a ship lost on its maiden voyage. The luxury and laughter of its passengers have been replaced by silence, decay, and restless spirits. The only way out is forward — but the deeper you explore, the more the ship’s deadly secrets emerge.

Key Features
Random Shark Spawns – Sharks are placed randomly in 5 rooms each playthrough (excluding Passenger Quarters and Dining Hall).

Look-First Survival Mechanic – Always look around upon entering a room; failing to do so can be fatal.

Ghost Door Trap – In the Dining Hall, a ghostly presence will trap you if you don’t look first.

Item-Based Progression – Acquire tools (Crowbar, Nut and Bolt, Knife, Map, Ancient Artifact, Metal Coffee Cup) to survive, solve obstacles, and escape.

Observation Deck Repair – Fix a broken door hinge using collected tools to reach the final stages.

Multiple Room Paths – Non-linear exploration with rooms linked in multiple directions.

Inventory System – Collect and manage items that influence survival and progression.

How to Play
Movement Commands:

N (North), S (South), E (East), W (West), U (Up), D (Down)

Other Commands:

L (Look Around) – Reveals items, hazards, and prevents ambushes.

I (Inventory) – Check what you’re carrying.

Tips for Survival:

Look first in every room to avoid shark attacks and traps.

Pick up all useful items; they may be critical later.

In the Dining Hall, use the Metal Coffee Cup to block the ghost’s door trap.

You cannot escape without both the Ancient Artifact and the Map Etched on Rotted Wood.

Win Condition
Reach the Escape Boat with the Ancient Artifact and Map. Without them, the gangsters won’t let you leave.

Developer Notes
This project was built as a CISP 360 final project. While relatively simple in concept, the combination of non-linear exploration, survival logic, and random hazards made it a fun challenge to code. Feel free to take any part of the code for your own use — just have fun with it.
